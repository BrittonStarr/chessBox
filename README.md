## Project Outline

This repository (and by extension this document) exists to help organize and gather my thoughts on my newest hobby electronics/coding project, the ChessBox.

The ChessBox is a small, lockable box meant for storing small amounts of documents or personal valuables, primarily in the form of security through obfuscation.  The basic concept is to use an arduino, a series of magnetically activated leaf switches, a chess board and pieces, and a linear solenoid to provide a means of access control to a small box that would otherwise be assumed to be an unremarkable piece of furniture. This was partially inspired by adafruit's lorwan chess project, but with being built with different activation and code mechanics.

## Parts list

-4 Magnetic triggering reed switches (sold in 5's commonly, so one spare)
